# 🛡 CAPTCHA Awareness

This scraper simulates real-world CAPTCHA detection. If a CAPTCHA is “detected”, the script will:
- Halt scraping
- Skip saving a broken dataset
- Log a warning to the console

This is a safe, ethical way to demonstrate awareness of scraping limitations — no bypass or violation of site terms involved.
